Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. AI is a broader field of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines that can perform human-like tasks.

Important areas in ML and AI include:
- Deep learning and neural networks
- Computer vision technologies
- Natural language understanding
- Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
- Pattern recognition

These technologies have applications in many sectors such as healthcare, finance, autonomous vehicles, and digital entertainment. AI and ML are transforming how we approach problem-solving and decision-making processes.
