Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed.

Key concepts in AI and ML include:
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Natural language processing
- Computer vision
- Supervised and unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

Applications of AI and ML are widespread across various industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. These technologies are revolutionizing how we solve complex problems and make decisions.
